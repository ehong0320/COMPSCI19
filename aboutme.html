		<h1>Eugene Hong</h1>
		<h2>High School Student ('22)</h2>
		<p>
		Hello! Welcome to my blog! My name is Eugene Hong and I currently a student at 
		the Waldorf School of Garden City. I'm incredibly passionate about music and love 
		to play sports. I've been playing the piano since the age of three, and I still love 
		to perform and practice to this day. I have been attending the Manhattan School 
		of Music and have taken various Master Classes at the Julliard Pre-College for 
		around eight years now because I see it as an opportunity to expand my musical 
		career. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and playing 
		basketball at the local gym.
		More info about my musical background can be found <a href="musicbio.html">here</a>!
