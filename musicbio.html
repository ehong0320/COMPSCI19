		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<h2>High School Student ('22)</h2>
<p><a href="aboutme.html">Eugene Hong</a> began studying the piano at age three and just 
two years later, performed the opening movement of Mozart’s Concerto No. 8 in C major, K. 246, 
with the New York Symphony Orchestra at Merkin Concert Hall, where his career as a pianist took off. 
This led to Eugene being accepted into the studio of Zenon Fishbein, under whose tutelage Eugene
entered the Manhattan School of Music’s Pre-College Division the following year.</p>

<p>Over the following few years, Eugene distinguished himself in numerous competitions. In
2012, Eugene was a winner of the Children’s Foundation for the Arts. In 2014, he was a
prizewinner in the Hartford Chopin competition and was chosen for the All State Piano
Showcase. The year after that, Eugene won first prize in the Associated Music Teacher
League (ATML) Scholarship Award Competition and the top prize in the New York
International Music Competition, which led to a performance with the New York
International Chamber Orchestra in Carnegie Hall. And soon after, he performed Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor, K. 466 with the Manhattan School of Music Pre-College
Division's Repertory Orchestra as winner of the Concerto Competition. More recently,
Eugene was the 2nd prize winner in the 2016 New York Music Competition YWCA at Merkin
Concert Hall, as well as the 2nd prize winner of the Piano Solo Competition in the 2017 New
York Debut Young Musicians Competition.</p>

<p>Eugene is also an avid recitalist, as demonstrated by his performance of the Dorothy Hales
Gary Scholarship Solo Recital and by the awarding of the 2016 Elva Van Gelder Memorial
Piano Scholarship from the Manhattan School of Music. Eugene has also played an eclectic
program of piano duos with Benjamin Rossen in Lincoln Center as the winner of the Young
Ensembles Lincoln Center Chamber Music Competition.</p>

<p>Today, Eugene continues to study the piano under Dr. Peter Vinograde, while receiving
invitations to attend masterclasses led by internationally renowned pianists such as Dr. Zhe
Tang. However, Eugene’s musical interests are not limited to playing the piano. As a violinist,
Eugene was selected for the Long Island String Festival in 2014 and 2016, as well as the All
County Music Festival in 2016 and 2017. He also joined several orchestras in those same
years, including the New York Laureate Orchestra, the Pace Youth Orchestra with Charles
Wang (Bayside High School Music Director), and the Great Neck South Middle School
Orchestra, for which he served as concertmaster.</p>
