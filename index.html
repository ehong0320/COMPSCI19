It has been announced that on the <u>26th of June</u>, the NYYS (New York Youth Symphony Members) and I will have a tour in Spain! 
I see this as an opportunity to get to know my fellow colleagues better and the culture outside of the United States. 
We will be touring around many populated cities in Spain such as Toledo, Es Escorial, Las Navas, Seville, Ronda, Malaga, 
and Valladolid. We will be staying in Spain for 12 days, so we have a lot of time to view the scenery, interact with the 
citizens, go to the beaches and more! I will be performing in all of the cities by playing with my chamber group as a pianist 
and in the orchestra as a violinist. The staff of the NYYS has put a lot of time and dedication to the trip; therefore, I will 
practice hard and try to make the most out of the trip!
